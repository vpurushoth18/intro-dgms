This only Repo Contains Deep Generative Models

1. Mixture of Gaussians (MoGs): a mixture of Gaussians 
2. Autoregressive Models (ARMs): ARMs parameterized with Causal Convolutionas and Transformers
3. Flow-based models (flows): RealNVP and IDFs (Integer Discrete Flows)
4. Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs): a plain VAE and various priors, a hierarchical VAE
5. Diffusion-based Deep Generative Models (DDGMs): a Gaussian forward diffusion
6. Score-based Generative Models (SBGMs): score matching, score-based generative models, (conditional) flow matching
7. Hybrid modeling
8. Energy-based Models
9. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
10. Neural Compression with Deep Generative Modeling
11. Large Language Models (LLMs)

The examples might look oversimplistic but that's the point! My idea is that everyone is able to follow every line of the code, and run the experiments within a couple of minutes on almost any laptop or computer. My goal is to encourage people who are new to understand and play with deep generative models. More advanced users, on the other hand, could refresh their knowledge or build on top of that to quickly check their ideas. Either way, I hope the code will help everyone to join a fascinating journey on deep generative modeling!
